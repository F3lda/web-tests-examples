No; if you give something position: relative and pull it up 10 pixels, it will move, but continue to occupy (in terms of its box) the 10 pixels below it that it previously occupied.

If you give something margin and pull it up 10 pixels, it moves up and brings everything underneath it with it, too.

<style>
    #relative, #margin { width: 100px; height: 200px; border: solid 1px; margin: 20px; float: left; padding: 30px; }
    #relative div, #margin div { background: red; width: 100%; height: 80px; margin-bottom: 10px; }
    #relative div:first-child { position: relative; top: -20px; }
    #margin div:first-child { margin-top: -20px; }
    </style>

<p>Demo: pulling up top DIV 10 pixels, firstly via position relative and secondly via negative margin top:</p>

<div id='relative'><div></div><div></div></div>
<div id='margin'><div></div><div></div></div>
